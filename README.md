# GRIND90 - A 90-Day DSA Preparation Journey

Welcome to my GRIND90 repository! This is my personal space for documenting a 90-day intensive preparation plan focused on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal is to build a rock-solid foundation, solve a wide range of problems, and develop the confidence needed to excel in technical interviews.

**Start Date:** July 21, 2025
**End Date:** October 18, 2025

## The Philosophy

* **Consistency over Intensity:** Small, focused efforts every day lead to massive results.
* **Pattern Recognition:** Focus on understanding the underlying patterns behind problems, not just memorizing solutions.
* **Active Recall:** Regularly revisit and re-solve problems to build long-term memory.
* **Deliberate Practice:** Go beyond just "solving" a problem. Understand its time/space complexity and articulate the trade-offs.

## The 12-Week Plan

This journey is broken down into three one-month phases, each with a specific focus.

* **Weeks 1-4: Core Data Structures**
    * **Topics:** Arrays, Strings, Hashing, Stacks & Queues.
    * **Goal:** Build an unshakeable foundation with the most common data structures.
* **Weeks 5-8: Non-Linear Data Structures**
    * **Topics:** Linked Lists, Trees (Binary, BST, Tries), & Heaps.
    * **Goal:** Master pointer-based structures and hierarchical data.
* **Weeks 9-12: Advanced Topics**
    * **Topics:** Graphs, Dynamic Programming & Advanced Algorithms.
    * **Goal:** Tackle complex problems and advanced problem-solving paradigms.
