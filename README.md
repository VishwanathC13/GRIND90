GRIND90 - A 90-Day DSA Preparation Journey
Welcome to my GRIND90 repository! This is my personal space for documenting a 90-day intensive preparation plan focused on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal is to build a rock-solid foundation, solve a wide range of problems, and develop the confidence needed to excel in technical interviews.

Start Date: July 21, 2025
End Date: October 18, 2025

The Philosophy
Consistency over Intensity: Small, focused efforts every day lead to massive results.

Pattern Recognition: Focus on understanding the underlying patterns behind problems, not just memorizing solutions.

Active Recall: Regularly revisit and re-solve problems to build long-term memory.

Deliberate Practice: Go beyond just "solving" a problem. Understand its time/space complexity and articulate the trade-offs.

The 12-Week Plan
This journey is broken down into three one-month phases, each with a specific focus.

Weeks 1-4: Core Data Structures

Topics: Arrays, Strings, Hashing, Stacks & Queues.

Goal: Build an unshakeable foundation with the most common data structures.

Weeks 5-8: Non-Linear Data Structures

Topics: Linked Lists, Trees (Binary, BST, Tries), & Heaps.

Goal: Master pointer-based structures and hierarchical data.

Weeks 9-12: Advanced Topics

Topics: Graphs, Dynamic Programming & Advanced Algorithms.

Goal: Tackle complex problems and advanced problem-solving paradigms.

Progress Log
This section will be updated weekly to track progress and maintain accountability.
